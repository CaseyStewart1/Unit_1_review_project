### WAM

#### Wack-a-Mole

#### Hit as many dots as you can before the timer runs out!

#### On game loading, dots start appearing and the user must click them away. When the dots are clicked, they will dissapear until the 'pop' function brings them back.

#### A score tracker logs the amount of dots the user has hit.

### **_*Technologies Used*_**

#### HTML

#### CSS

#### JavaScript

---

### **_*Key Technologies Used*_**

#### CSS - 'visibility' is integral to the game's function, allowing the dots to disappear and reappear.

#### Javascript - Timers on the javascript side tie to 'visibility' allowing the dots to behave more randomly.
